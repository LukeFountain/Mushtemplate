 ## Change button to say “Order now”

 ## Add “!” to the end of products description after “ready”.

## Latin words = “Our products are currently being sold for delivery only. 

## Pre-ordered mushrooms will be delivery within two days after harvest and our team will work with you to only a delivery appointment. Currently products are only available to residents in the Charlotte metropolitan area. Please contact us with any questions.” ~~ Link “contact us” to form at bottom of page.

## Create new tab: Wholesale

All Tabs:
    Should the store button be placed outside the “multiple tab card” (IDK what this is called?

Maybe make a larger “Order Now” button either above or below? I think having a button on each tab is redundant. 
    Can store links open in new tab? Which is better?

## Copywriting update:

## Mush! is partnering with Envision Charlotte to grow mushrooms at the Innovation Barn. As a part of the future vision for Charlotte to create circular economies, the Innovation Barn will be the educational ground zero for learning and development. Mush! will be focused on using the power of fungi to convert waste into delicious food and products. Mushrooms have a huge potential to improve our environment while providing a nutritious food source. While the Innovation Barn receiving the final touches, our products are being delivery but will be available for purchase onsite in fall of 2021. Please view our store and complete our survey to help direct our path as we push forward with fungi!
